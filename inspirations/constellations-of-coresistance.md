"Constellations of Coresistance" by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, published in book "As We Have Always Done: Indigenous Freedom through Radical Resistance"

Opening paragraph:
"Stars, in Edna Manitowabi’s telling of the Seven Fires creation story, represent the thoughts of Gzhwe Manidoo. In the first attempt at creating this world, Gzhwe Manidoo’s  thoughts and ideas went out into the universe in perpetuity because there was no physical structure to embody them. That’s  the first layer of knowledge that stars carry. They are a reminder  that thought (the sound of the rattle) has to be combined with  heart and motion (the sound of the drum) in order to have energy and influence. These are the sounds of the skyworld holding  the universe together, because sound creates and maintains relationships that embody both intellectual and emotional knowledge, otherwise known in Nishnaabeg thought as knowledge."
